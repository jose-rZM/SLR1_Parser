# SLR1_Parser
This repository contains the implementation of an SLR(1) parser, a type of bottom-up parser used for syntax analysis in compiler design. The parser reads an input string of tokens and determines whether the string belongs to the language specified by a given context-free grammar (CFG).

Please note that this project is **currently under development**. The program is capable of constructing the action and goto tables, and printing them to stdout. Future improvements include optimizing efficiency and completing the parsing method.
So, please, be patient~
